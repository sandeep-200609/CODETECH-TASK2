Project Title:
Bluetooth-Controlled Home Automation System
 Objective:
To design and implement a Bluetooth-based system that allows the user to wirelessly switch home electrical appliances ON and OFF using a smartphone and an Arduino microcontroller.

 Project Concept:
This home automation system leverages Bluetooth communication to receive control commands from a mobile phone and uses an Arduino to interpret those commands and trigger relays, which control the connected electrical devices (like a fan, bulb, or TV).

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components:
Component	Description
Arduino UNO/Nano	Main controller that processes commands
HC-05 Bluetooth Module	Enables wireless communication with phone
Relay Module (5V)	Acts as a switch to control AC appliances
Smartphone	Used to send control signals via Bluetooth
Power Supply (5V)	Powers the Arduino and modules
Resistors (1kŒ© and 2kŒ©)	For voltage level shifting on HC-05 RX
AC appliances	Lamps, fans, etc., to be controlled
Jumper wires, breadboard	For prototyping connections

 Working Principle:
The smartphone connects to the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

The user sends commands (1, 0, etc.) via a Bluetooth terminal app.

The HC-05 receives these signals and passes them to the Arduino via UART.

The Arduino reads the command and turns ON/OFF the relay module accordingly.

The relay switches the connected appliance ON or OFF based on the command.

If you want an image of this schematic, I can generate one‚Äîjust ask.

 Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE ‚Äì for uploading code to Arduino.

Bluetooth Terminal App (Android) ‚Äì to send commands (e.g., "1" for ON, "0" for OFF).

 Mobile App Setup:
Download Bluetooth Terminal HC-05 or Arduino Bluetooth Controller.

Pair your phone with HC-05 (password: 1234 or 0000).

Connect in the app and send:

1 ‚Üí Turns ON the device

0 ‚Üí Turns OFF the device

 Advantages:
Wireless control without the internet

Cost-effective solution for smart homes

Simple and expandable to multiple devices

Easy to use and build

 Applications:
Control lights, fans, or TVs

Elderly or disabled support system

Office and industrial automation (basic)
